🌐 First Website Project – Second Year of Software Engineering
This was the first website I ever created during my second year of Software Engineering at the University of Otago. It was built as part of a COSC203 assignment and can be viewed here:

The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a simple project, but I had fun experimenting with basic web technologies and adding a small animation of a bird flying across the screen — one of my favorite touches!
